      # This "urgent at' concept was useful in one of the domains StonePath
      # was written/extracted from.  The idea is thatm while something is 'due'
      # at a specific time, it might become urgent shortly before it is due.
      # In that domain, we color-coded tasks as green (due date is far out)
      # yellow (urgent timestap has passed), and red (overdue - due date  
      # has passed).  This won't become part of the framework, but I like the
      # idea so much I thought I'd comment it here until it gets in some
      # official documentation for 'advanced usage'.
      # t.datetime :urgent_at
      
      # Your attributes should be defined here.
